### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·).

In my free time I like to workout, to watch movies and series, to read books, and to play the guitar.

I am currently focused on studying and learning JavaScript technologies such as Node.js and React.js.

I'm always looking for new challenges and projects where I can develop myself, improve my skills, and positively impact the world and peopleâ€™s lives.

Would you like to find me?
