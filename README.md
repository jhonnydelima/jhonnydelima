I'm a Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience building scalable and high-performance applications using Typescript, React, React Native, Node.js, NestJS, APIs REST, GraphQL, and so on. I have a strong background in software architecture, data management, and system optimisation, backed by a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a Master's in Information Systems. Currently I'm expanding expertise in Cloud and DevOps to bridge the gap between development and infrastructure.

Would you like to find me?
