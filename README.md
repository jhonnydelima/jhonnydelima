### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer from Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·).

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer, to watch movies and series, to read books, and to play the guitar.

The technologies that I'm currently studing/using are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, NodeJS, React, and others.

Would you like to find me?
