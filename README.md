### Hi there! 👋

I'm a Software Developer from Brazil (🇧🇷).

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and to play the guitar (🎸).

The technologies that I'm currently studing/using are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, NodeJS, React, and others.

Would you like to find me?
